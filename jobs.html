                    <h3><b>Front End vs Back End Development</b></h3>
                    Front-end development is about the user experience. it is the job of a front-end developer to create the user interface and build a modern and intuitive user experience. The key skills of a front-end developer are the ability to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript as these are the essential programming languages for building a webpage. HTML is the language that builds the elements of the webpage. Everything that you see on a website is built using HMTL. CSS is the language that it gives structure, colour and design to the webpage and without it you would just see a list of elements and content. It is also used to make the website responsive and adapt to the platform it is being viewed on like mobile, desktop or tablet and the properties of the device. JavaScript is used to make the website interactive and controls things like movement and scrolling elements. This isn't essential to building the webpage as HTML and CSS is but it is still key to creating a professional website so it must be a part of every aspiring web developer's arsenal. A front-end developer also needs to keep up with modern design trends so that their work maintains a modern look.

                <p>
                    The back-end is what controls things like calculations, business logic, database interactions and performance; things that the user doesn't see but are still key to the user experience. A poorly created back-end will result in poor and buggy performance which can be just as bad as an bad front-end. A back-end developer needs to be fluent in languages like Ruby, Python and SQL. Ruby is used to code business logic and calculate data and is popular among small startup companies and is very easy to read. Python is used on the server side and is useful for data analysis and building frameworks and SQL is used for managing databases and data control and manipulation.

                <p>
                    Front-end and back-end development are both well paid careers, earning an average base pay of roughly £40,600 a year and £52,500 a year, respectively.
