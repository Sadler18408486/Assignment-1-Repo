                    One of its best features is a comprehensive list of HTML elements which includes a description of the element and examples of how it is used, showing the code and what it produces. You can interact and edit the code and see the example page update in real time which helps you to learn and understand what the code is doing.

                    <h3>Material.io</h3>
                    Material.io is an informative website that shows you how to use "material design" to style your website with a modern look. It covers everything from the layout to structure to shape and colour. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The site has several tools to help in designing your website. There is a colour tool that gives you a preview of how you colour scheme will look and gives you light and dark variations of the selected colour. It also has an accessibility section which shows the legibility of black and white text on each colour and the minimum opacity that text will become legible.
